# Project plan feedback
* The project theme is really fun!
* As you acknowledge, the program structure still needs some work, but it's definitely a good starting point
* The plan doesn't mention testing at all. It may be a good idea to either assign it as a responsibility to a member or make it a milestone to make sure that you don't forget to do it. The tests don't have to be anything fancy but some tests are required.
* The illustrations are nice
* Overall it's a good plan
